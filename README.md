grunt-nuget
===========

[Grunt][grunt] task that works as a wrapper for NuGet.exe commands.

## Getting Started

Install this grunt plugin next to your project's gruntfile with: `npm install grunt-nuget --save-dev`

Then add this line to your project's `Gruntfile.js` :

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-nuget');
```

Then specify your config:

```javascript
  grunt.initConfig({
    nuget: {
      options: {
        /** @optional, no longer required, location of NuGet.exe */
        location: './Tools/NuGet/NuGet.exe',
        /** @optional, no longer required, mono runtime version (right now it only works with mono) */
        runtimeVersion: 'v4.0'
      },
      restore: {
        /** @required command to execute for the given target */
        command: 'restore',
        /** @optional  additional arguments to pass to NuGet.exe */
        args: 'restore',
      }
    }
  });
```
